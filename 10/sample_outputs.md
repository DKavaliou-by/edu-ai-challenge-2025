**Input:** "I need a smartphone under $800 with a great camera and long battery life"

**Output:**
```
Enter your product search criteria (e.g., "I want headphones under $100 that are in stock"):
> I need a smartphone under $800 with a great camera and long battery life

```

**Analysis:**
- The OpenAI function calling extracted the max_price filter ($800)
- The system returned all Electronics products under $800
- Note: The smartphone in the dataset is $799.99 but shows as "Out of Stock", so it wasn't included in results
- The function calling successfully parsed the price constraint from natural language

## Test Run 2: Fitness Equipment Search

**Input:** "Show me fitness equipment under $50 with good ratings"

**Output:**
```
Enter your product search criteria (e.g., "I want headphones under $100 that are in stock"):
> show me fitness equipment under $50 with food ratings

**Analysis:**
- The OpenAI function calling extracted the max_price filter ($50)
- The system correctly identified and filtered Fitness category products

- The function calling successfully parsed both the category and price constraints

2. **Price Filtering:** Both queries correctly applied max_price constraints
3. **Category Detection:** The second query properly identified "fitness equipment" as the Fitness category
4. **Natural Language Processing:** The system handles various ways users might phrase their requests
5. **Real-time Processing:** No test mode indicators, confirming the API key is working
6. **Filtered Results:** Only products matching the extracted criteria are returned
