# Enigma Machine CLI

enigma.js contains a simplified command-line Enigma machine implementation. The Enigma was a rotor-based cipher device used for secure communication in the early 20th century.

## Usage

You can use the CLI to encrypt or decrypt messages using a configurable Enigma setup (rotors, plugboard, reflector).

## How to Run

1. **Ensure you have Node.js installed.**
2. **Navigate to the directory with enigma.js** in your terminal.
3. **Run the program** using:
   ```bash
   node enigma.js
   ```
4. **Follow the prompts** to enter your message and configuration.

## Detailed Instructions

When you run the program, you will be prompted for several configuration options:

### 1. Enter message
- Type the message you want to encrypt or decrypt. Only A-Z letters are processed; other characters are passed through unchanged.

### 2. Rotor positions (e.g. `0 0 0`)
- Enter three numbers (space-separated), each from 0 to 25, representing the initial position of each rotor (left to right). For example, `0 0 0` means all rotors start at 'A'.

### 3. Ring settings (e.g. `0 0 0`)
- Enter three numbers (space-separated), each from 0 to 25, representing the ring setting for each rotor. The ring setting shifts the internal wiring of the rotor. Historically, this was used to add another layer of security.

### 4. Plugboard pairs (e.g. `AB CD`)
- Enter pairs of letters (no separator between letters, space between pairs) to swap on the plugboard. For example, `AB CD` swaps A<->B and C<->D. You can leave this blank for no plugboard swaps.

### Example Session
```
$ node enigma.js
Enter message: HELLOWORLD
Rotor positions (e.g. 0 0 0): 0 0 0
Ring settings (e.g. 0 0 0): 0 0 0
Plugboard pairs (e.g. AB CD): QW ER
Output: ZISNQXQKGA
```

### Notes
- The machine always uses rotors I, II, and III (historical Enigma I order, rightmost rotor steps every keypress).
- Only uppercase A-Z are encrypted; all other characters are output unchanged.
- The same settings must be used to decrypt a message as were used to encrypt it.

## Testing

This project includes comprehensive unit tests to verify correct Enigma operation.

### Running Tests

**Basic test run:**
```bash
node test.js
```

**Using npm scripts:**
```bash
npm test
```

### Test Coverage

To get test coverage information, first install the coverage tool:

```bash
npm install
```

**Run tests with coverage:**
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

**Generate HTML coverage report:**
```bash
npm run test:coverage-html
```

**Save coverage report to file only:**
```bash
npm run test:coverage-file
```

The HTML report will be generated in the `coverage` directory. Open `coverage/index.html` in your browser to view detailed coverage information. Coverage output is automatically saved to `test_report.txt` for CI/CD integration.

### What the Tests Cover

The test suite verifies:
- âœ… Basic rotor stepping mechanics
- âœ… Rotor notch detection and positioning
- âœ… Single rotor advancement behavior
- âœ… Critical double-stepping logic (fixed bug)
- âœ… Plugboard functionality (dual application)
- âœ… Ring settings effect on encryption
- âœ… Full encryption/decryption symmetry
- âœ… Non-alphabetic character handling
- âœ… Position wraparound at boundaries
- âœ… Complex multi-step scenarios

### Test Output Example

```
ðŸ§ª Running Enigma Machine Tests...

âœ… Rotor Basic Stepping
âœ… Rotor Notch Detection  
âœ… Single Rotor Stepping
âœ… Double Stepping Logic
âœ… Plugboard Swap Function
âœ… No Plugboard Configuration
âœ… Ring Settings Effect
âœ… Known Test Vector - Basic
âœ… Non-alphabetic Characters Pass Through
âœ… Rotor Position Wraparound
âœ… Full Encryption Cycle Symmetry
âœ… Complex Double Stepping Scenario

âœ… All tests passed! The Enigma machine is working correctly.
```

The tests ensure the implementation matches historical Enigma I machine behavior and verify that both critical bugs (double-stepping and dual plugboard application) have been properly fixed.
