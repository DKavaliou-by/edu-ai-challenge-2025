I am designing a social platform that is expected to have millions of users. I need your help choosing the most suitable type of database.

Please apply Chain-of-Thought reasoning to analyze and select the best option, step by step, based on these project requirements:

- The platform will store user profiles, posts, and connections (like followers/friends).
- The workload is expected to be 80% reads and 20% writes.
- High data read speed is critical.
- The system must be scalable to support user growth.

Your reasoning should:

- Consider and compare different types of databases (e.g., relational, document, graph, key-value, wide-column).
- Justify why one type is most suitable based on the features required.
- Conclude with a clear recommendation for the most appropriate type of database and optionally suggest specific technologies.
