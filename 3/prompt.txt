 I have a JavaScript function implementation called `processUserData.js`, and I need a deep, multi-perspective review of this code.

 Please apply **role prompting** and analyze the following code from **three expert perspectives**, one at a time:

 1. **Experienced JavaScript Developer** – Focus on code clarity, best practices, modularity, and maintainability.
 2. **Security Engineer** – Identify potential vulnerabilities, bad practices, or missing validation/sanitization.
 3. **Performance Specialist** – Evaluate algorithmic efficiency, memory usage, and any possible optimizations.

 For each expert, provide:

 * A short analysis summary
 * Actionable, specific recommendations to improve the code
 * Comments on what is currently good (if any)

 Here is the code:

 ```javascript
 function processUserData(data: any) {
   var users = [];

   for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
     var user = {
       id: data[i].id,
       name: data[i].name,
       email: data[i].email,
       active: data[i].status === 'active' ? true : false
     };
     users.push(user);
   }
   console.log("Processed " + users.length + " users");
   return users;
 }

 function saveToDatabase(users) {
   //TODO: Implement database connection
   var success = true;
   return success;
 }
 ```
