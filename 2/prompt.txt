I have an informal bug note and I need your help turning it into a proper bug report.
Please apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to:

1. Analyze the informal bug note to identify key information.
2. Use logical steps to infer missing but useful context (e.g., environment, severity).
3. Generate a clear, well-structured bug ticket in the following format:
- Title
- Description
- Steps to Reproduce
- Expected vs Actual Behavior
- Environment (if known)
- Severity or Impact

Here's the informal bug note:
"Logout button doesn’t work on Safari. It just doesn’t respond."
