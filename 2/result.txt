 **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**

 1. The core issue is that the logout button fails to work, but only on Safari.
 2. "Doesn’t respond" likely means there is no click event, or no visible effect when clicked.
 3. Since the browser is mentioned, this may be a **Safari-specific compatibility issue**.
 4. The feature (logout) is critical for user session management, so the impact could be high.
 5. No explicit steps are provided, but we can assume common user actions.

 **Bug Ticket:**

 **Title:**
 Logout Button Unresponsive on Safari Browser

 **Description:**
 When using Safari, the logout button on the application does not respond when clicked. This prevents users from being able to end their sessions normally, which can pose a security concern.

 **Steps to Reproduce:**

 1. Open the application in the Safari browser
 2. Log in with a valid user account
 3. Attempt to click the "Logout" button in the header or user menu

 **Expected vs Actual Behavior:**

 * **Expected:** User is logged out and redirected to the login page
 * **Actual:** Nothing happens upon clicking the logout button; no response or error is shown

 **Environment:**

 * Browser: Safari (version unknown)
 * OS: macOS (assumed based on Safari usage)

 **Severity or Impact:**
 High — logout is a critical function, and its failure poses user session and security risks on affected browsers
