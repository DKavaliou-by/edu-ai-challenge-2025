# Development Log - Audio File Validator

## Step 1: Create Audio File Validator App
- **Date**: Current session
- **Request**: "Create a Node.js console app that asks the user to provide the path to an audio file (e.g., audio.mp3) via command line using readline-sync or inquirer. Validate that the file exists."
- **Action**: Created complete Node.js console application
- **Files Created**:
  - `package.json` - Project configuration with inquirer dependency
  - `index.js` - Main application with file validation logic
  - `README.md` - Documentation and usage instructions
- **Key Features Implemented**:
  - Interactive CLI using inquirer (chosen over readline-sync for better UX)
  - File existence validation using fs.existsSync()
  - File type validation (ensures it's a file, not directory)
  - Audio file extension validation
  - Detailed file information display
  - Comprehensive error handling
- **Dependencies**: inquirer, fs
- **Status**: ✅ Complete and ready to run with `npm start`

## Step 2: Add Audio Transcription with Whisper API
- **Date**: Current session
- **Request**: "Write a Node.js function that sends an audio file to OpenAI's Whisper API (whisper-1) for transcription. Use form-data and axios. Return the transcribed text."
- **Action**: Integrated OpenAI Whisper API for audio transcription.
- **Files Created**:
  - `transcribe.js` - Module to handle communication with the Whisper API.
  - `.gitignore` - To exclude `node_modules` and `.env`.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `index.js` - Added logic to prompt user for transcription and display results.
  - `package.json` - Added `axios`, `form-data`, and `dotenv` dependencies.
  - `README.md` - Updated documentation for the new transcription feature and API key setup.
- **Key Features Implemented**:
  - Used `axios` and `form-data` to send `multipart/form-data` requests.
  - Handled API key securely using `dotenv` and a `.env` file.
  - Added a confirmation prompt before sending the file for transcription.
  - Separated API logic into its own module (`transcribe.js`) for better code organization.
  - Robust error handling for API requests.
- **Dependencies Added**: `axios`, `form-data`, `dotenv`
- **Status**: ✅ Complete. Requires a valid `OPENAI_API_KEY` in a `.env` file to function.

## Step 3: Fix Startup Error
- **Date**: Current session
- **Request**: "npm start is not working"
- **Problem**: The application was crashing on startup with an `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` error. This was caused by a recent update to the `inquirer` package which now uses ES Module syntax (`import`) instead of CommonJS (`require`).
- **Action**: Resolved the startup error by downgrading the `inquirer` package to a compatible version.
- **Command Executed**: `npm install inquirer@8.2.4`
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `package.json` & `package-lock.json`: Updated to reflect the downgraded version of `inquirer`.
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed. The application now starts and runs as expected.

## Step 4: Add Automatic Transcription File Saving
- **Date**: Current session
- **Request**: "After receiving the transcription, save it as markdown to a new file named transcription.md. If the file exists, create a new one like transcription-1.md, transcription-2.md, etc."
- **Action**: Implemented automatic saving of transcriptions to markdown files with unique naming.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `index.js` - Added `generateUniqueFilename()` and `saveTranscriptionToFile()` functions, integrated file saving into the transcription flow.
  - `README.md` - Updated documentation to include the new file saving feature and naming convention.
- **Key Features Implemented**:
  - Automatic generation of unique filenames using timestamp and original filename.
  - Incremental numbering system (transcription-1.md, transcription-2.md, etc.) when files already exist.
  - Markdown formatting with metadata (original file path, transcription date).
  - Integration with existing transcription flow.
- **Naming Convention**: `transcription-{original-filename}-{timestamp}.md`
- **Status**: ✅ Complete. Transcriptions are now automatically saved with unique names.

## Step 5: Add GPT-4o-mini Summarization
- **Date**: Current session
- **Request**: "Write a function that sends the transcription text to GPT-4o-mini to generate a concise summary of the main ideas. Format the summary as markdown and save it to summary.md (auto-increment if needed)."
- **Action**: Implemented GPT-4o-mini powered summarization with automatic file saving.
- **Files Created**:
  - `summarize.js` - Module to handle GPT-4o-mini API communication for summarization.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `index.js` - Added `saveSummaryToFile()` function and integrated summarization workflow with user prompts.
  - `README.md` - Updated documentation to include summarization features and file types.
- **Key Features Implemented**:
  - GPT-4o-mini API integration for intelligent summarization.
  - Automatic summary file saving with unique naming convention.
  - User confirmation prompt for summary generation.
  - Markdown formatting for summaries with metadata.
  - Error handling for API failures.
- **Naming Convention**: `summary-{original-filename}-{timestamp}.md`
- **Status**: ✅ Complete. Summaries are now automatically generated and saved with unique names.

## Step 6: Add GPT-4o-mini Analytics
- **Date**: Current session
- **Request**: "Send the full transcription to GPT-4o-mini and ask it to return JSON with the following analytics: Total word count, Speaking speed in words per minute, Top 3+ frequently mentioned topics (and how many times each is mentioned). Save this as analysis.json."
- **Action**: Implemented GPT-4o-mini powered analytics with structured JSON output and automatic file saving.
- **Files Created**:
  - `analyze.js` - Module to handle GPT-4o-mini analytics API communication and JSON file saving.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `index.js` - Added `getAudioDuration()` function and integrated analytics workflow with user prompts for duration input.
  - `README.md` - Updated documentation to include analytics features, JSON structure, and file types.
- **Key Features Implemented**:
  - GPT-4o-mini API integration for intelligent analytics generation.
  - Structured JSON output with exact format specification.
  - User input for audio duration (required for speaking speed calculation).
  - Automatic analytics file saving with unique naming convention.
  - JSON validation and error handling for API responses.
  - Integration with existing transcription workflow.
- **Analytics Structure**:
  - Word count
  - Speaking speed (words per minute)
  - Top 3+ frequently mentioned topics with mention counts
- **Naming Convention**: `analysis-{original-filename}-{timestamp}.json`
- **Status**: ✅ Complete. Analytics are now automatically generated and saved as structured JSON files.

## Step 7: Fix OpenAI Model Access Error
- **Date**: Current session
- **Request**: "I got an error: Project does not have access to model gpt-4o-mini. Make sure we use gpt-4.1-mini model"
- **Problem**: The application was using `gpt-4o-mini` model which the user's OpenAI project doesn't have access to, causing API errors.
- **Action**: Updated all model references from `gpt-4o-mini` to `gpt-4.1-mini` across all files.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `summarize.js` - Updated model name in API call and documentation.
  - `index.js` - Updated console messages to reflect correct model name.
  - `README.md` - Updated all documentation references to use correct model name.
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed. All GPT API calls now use `gpt-4.1-mini` which the user's project has access to.
